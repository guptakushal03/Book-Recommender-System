driving over lemons: an optimist in andalucía,historybiography,"when english sheep shearer chris stewart (once a drummer for genesis) bought an isolated farmhouse in the mountains outside of granada, spain, he was fully aware that it didn't have electricity, running water, or access to roads. but he had little idea of the headaches and hilarity that would follow (including scorpions, runaway sheep, and the former owner who won't budge). he also had no idea that his memoir about southern spain would set a standard for literary travel writing. this rip-roaringly funny book about seeking a place in an earthy community of peasants and shepherds gives a realistic sense of the hassles and rewards of foreign relocation. part of its allure stems from the absence of rose-colored glasses, mainly stewart's refusal to merely coo about the piece of heaven he's found or to portray all residents as angels. stewart's hilarious and beautifully written passages are deep in their honest perceptions of the place and the sometimes xenophobic natives, whose reception of the newcomers ranges from warm to gruff. after reading about struggles with dialects, animal husbandry, droughts, flooding, and such local rituals as pig slaughters and the rebuilding of bridges, you may not wish to live chris stewart's life. but you can't help but admire him and his wife, ana, for digging out a niche in these far-flung mountains, for successfully befriending the denizens, and for so eloquently and comically telling the truth. the rich, vibrant, and unromanticized candor of driving over lemonsmakes it a laudable standout in a genre too often typified by laughable naivete. --melissa rossi When English sheep shearer Chris Stewart (once a drummer for Genesis) bought an isolated farmhouse in the mountains outside of Granada, Spain, he was fully aware that it didn't have electricity, running water, or access to roads.

An array of working-class witnesses describe how life in post-war Britain is, with little regard for liberal niceties or the feelings of their 'betters'. Many of these voices will stay with the reader in future volumes, jostling alongside well-known figures like John Arlott (here making his first radio broadcast, still in police uniform), Glenda Jackson (taking the 11+) and Doris Lessing, newly arrived from Africa, struck by the levelling poverty of postwar Britain. David Kynaston weaves a sophisticated narrative of how the victorious 1945 Labour government shaped the political, economic and social landscape for the next three decades.Deeply researched, often amusing and always intensely entertaining and readable, the first volume of David Kynaston's ambitious history offers an entirely fresh perspective on Britain during those six momentous years."

And worse, although there is no proof, they are believed to be responsible for the disappearance of two village children. The entire town is devastated and paralyzed by fear. Roger, playfully ""hocked"" by a group of women, then rescued and let go with only a kiss apiece as his ransom, stays in the village for a few days' rest. Hearing the tale of the missing children from his handsome rescuer, Grizelda Harbourne, who was also the two children's nurse, Roger gets caught up in their story. But his God-given mind for mysteries, and his heightened sense of danger, are baffled: How did the children get out of the house unnoticed in broad daylight? Why did they leave, and where did they go? Would the outlaws really kill just for the sake of killing? Roger cannot rest - or rule out the possibility of more violence - until he solves the puzzle."

double cross,historybiography,"d-day, 6 june 1944, the turning point of the second world war, was a victory of arms. but it was also a triumph for a different kind of operation: one of deceit, aimed at convincing the nazis that calais and norway, not normandy, were the targets of the 150,000-strong invasion force. the deception involved every branch of allied wartime intelligence - the bletchley park code-breakers, mi5, mi6, soe, scientific intelligence, the fbi and the french resistance. but at its heart was the 'double cross system', a team of double agents controlled by the secret twenty committee, so named because twenty in roman numerals forms a double cross. the key d-day spies were just five in number, and one of the oddest military units ever assembled: a bisexual peruvian playgirl, a tiny polish fighter pilot, a serbian seducer, a wildly imaginative spaniard with a diploma in chicken farming, and a hysterical frenchwoman whose obsessive love for her pet dog very nearly wrecked the entire deception. their enterprise was saved from catastrophe by a shadowy sixth spy whose heroic sacrifice is here revealed for the first time. under the direction of an eccentric but brilliant intelligence officer in tartan trousers, working from a smoky lair in st james's, these spies would weave a web of deception so intricate that it ensnared hitler's army and helped to carry thousands of troops across the channel in safety. these double agents were, variously, brave, treacherous, fickle, greedy and inspired. they were not conventional warriors, but their masterpiece of deceit saved countless lives. their codenames were bronx, brutus, treasure, tricycle and garbo. this is their story.

Anger be now your song, immortal one, Akhilleus' anger, doomed and ruinous, that caused the Akhaians loss on bitter loss and crowded brave souls into the undergloom, leaving so many dead men-carrion for dogs and birds; and the will of Zeus was done. -Lines 1-6 Since it was first published more than twenty-five years ago, Robert Fitzgerald's prizewinning translation of Homer's battle epic has become a classic in its own right: a standard against which all other versions of The Iliad are compared. Fitzgerald's work is accessible, ironic, faithful, written in a swift vernacular blank verse that ""makes Homer live as never before"" (Library Journal)."

Sharing one too many martinis, the strangers begin to play a game of truth, revealing very intimate details about themselves. Ted talks about his marriage that’s going stale and his wife Miranda, who he’s sure is cheating on him.
