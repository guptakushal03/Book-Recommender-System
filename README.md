# Book Recommender System

This Python script creates a book recommender system with a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. The system allows users to select a book from a dataset and receive recommendations based on the similarity of books in the dataset.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: The system loads a precomputed DataFrame containing book information and a similarity matrix calculated based on the book descriptions.
  
- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Upon selecting a book and clicking the "Recommend" button, the system calculates similarity scores between the selected book and others in the dataset. It then returns the top 5 recommended books based on these scores.
  
- **User Interface**: The user interface is designed using Streamlit and includes a title, a dropdown menu for selecting a book, and a button to trigger the recommendation process.

## How It Works

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas
    ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command to run the Streamlit application:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. **Select a Book**: Choose a book from the dropdown menu displayed on the web interface.

4. **Get Recommendations**: Click the "Recommend" button to view the top 5 recommended books based on the selected book's similarity scores.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a collection of books along with their genres and descriptions. It has been preprocessed and formatted for compatibility with the recommender system algorithm.

## Usage

- This application is intended as a demonstration of how a simple book recommender system can be implemented using Streamlit.
- Users can explore its functionality and adapt it for their own datasets or integrate more advanced recommendation algorithms.

## Note

- The system's performance depends on the quality and size of the dataset as well as the accuracy of the similarity calculation algorithm.
- This project serves as a starting point for building more sophisticated recommendation systems and exploring user interaction in web applications.
